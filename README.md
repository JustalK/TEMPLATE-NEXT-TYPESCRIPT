## TEMPLATE-NEXT-TYPESCRIPT

## Goal

This project is a template for creating a website with `Next.js` and `TypeScript` using my favorite tools.

This project use `eslint` and `prettier` for enforcing the style through the project. I also use `cypress` for managing the end-to-end test and the code coverage.

Finally, I am using `jsdoc` and `better-doc` for having a beautiful development documentation.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.
